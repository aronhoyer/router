# A simple Node.js router

This router was made as an experiment to see if I could make a router that let me raw dog more of
Node"s built-in modules in a "back to monkey" type effort.

Whereas libraries like Express, Koa and Hapi are entire server frameworks, this library is a router
and nothing else. It was never meant to be something else and will never be anything else.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this in production code. This was a pet project and I don't plan to regularily maintain it.
> However, if you've read the [source](./src/router.ts) and understand it, feel free to fork it.
